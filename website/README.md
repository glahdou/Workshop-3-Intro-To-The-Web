# Intro to the Web Workshop: Your Website!

In this folder, you will create your own interactive personal site! As you may have noticed, no starter files have been provided. It is up to you to create them and fill them in using your IDE

**Hint: in most IDE's, such as VS Code, you can click on a folder (so in this case, the folder 'website') and you should get an option for "New File"

You will want three files for this site: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js`. Note that while you generally should call the home page of your site `index.html` by convention, you can call your CSS and JavaScript files whatever you want.

This site will have various features:

* A main title, that is your name, and in your favorite color
* Your most flattering picture of you
* A short bio, introducing you to the world
* A button that will greet the visitor of your site
* A link to your favorite site
* Anything else you want!

This may not be the most attractive page on the web. But it will be your own, and that's all that counts. Good luck!
